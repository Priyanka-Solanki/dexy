This directory contains a configuration file for a mongrel2 server which will
serve live Dexy pages which are automatically rebuilt whenever contents change.

You need to install ZeroMQ and mongrel2 before you can run this.

Please read the mongrel2 documentation carefully and get the mongrel2 example
servers running before you try to run this.

======================
Setup (the first time)
======================

For security, edit the UUIDs in server.conf. The UUID in the dexy_app
handler section should match the UUID in bin/dexy-live-server. If you change
this, don't forget to run "python setup.py install" or "python setup.py
develop" afterwards so the dexy-live-server command is updated on your system.

On some systems, you can generate UUIDs with the command 'uuidgen'

Use the m2sh interface to generate a config.sqlite file which will store the
server configuration. Probably just:

m2sh load -config server.conf

Then create directories called logs, run and tmp for mongrel2.

========================================
Starting the Server (first & every time)
========================================

Use the m2sh interface to start the mongrel2 server

sudo m2sh start -host localhost


Now we need to set up the handler in our Dexy project directory. Navigate to
the Dexy project directory where you want to serve files from. In the dexy
project root, type:

dexy-live-server .


That should be it, you can start browsing your files by visiting:

http://localhost:6767/

or

http://192.168.1.XXX:6767/

As appropriate.



If you run into problems, check both the Dexy logs in your project directory
and the mongrel2 logs in the logs subdirectory of this directory.
